# IT3600 Midterm Project

### Description of UX Problem:
A common problem identified in real-life examples is the user experience of working with microwaves and air fryers. These devices often have unnecessarily complicated user interfaces, leading to frustration of working with the various settings and buttons, only to receive limited feedback from the interface on the status of your task. As shown below, we see there is a pushable knob that retracts in and out to adjust the cook time of the process. After pushing the knob in, pressing start does not start the cycle. Buttons also exist with different, unlabeled values on the main interface. A clock button exists, as do two “P” and “M” buttons with an unclear purpose after interfacing with the display. The actual process of placing your object in the microwave, setting your desired cook time, and beginning the process is unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive.

### Usability Critique: 

Although a usability critique of microwaves in general could be levied, the focus is on the specific interface pictured above. This interface does not feature an actual door to open and close the microwave door, instead opting for an unlabeled push button. This setup is generally unintuitive, but poses difficulty to people with disabilities who struggle with a pushing motion. Including a push button to open the door, in conjunction with an easy to use door, would make just this aspect of beginning the process painless for the user in the beginning. Additionally, a major issue lies in the dial / knob based configuration of cook times. Although it looks novel, that is likely for good reason. Directions for microwaving different items is often listed in explicit terms, meaning giving users a way to directly specify that time without needing to scroll by every time below their desired time requires additional effort from the user. Additionally, long cook times mean the user is forced to manually scroll the dial in an effort to reach their cook time, despite the fact there are also numbers of large, random quantities on the user interface, adding to the confusion of the setup. Allowing the dial to be pushed in and out also adds to the complexity of this simple task, as users now are left wondering if pushing the dial in or out is required to achieve some end goal (like starting the microwave, opening the door, etc). 


### Proposed Solution: 

My proposed solution is to make the configuration and execution of a simple task involving the microwave's user interface intuitive, simple, and accessible. This begins by approaching the proposed solution to target the same audience and accomplish the same end goal but increase accessibility and decreased user cognitive load (as demonstrated in the reference video). This microwave appears to have a polished, modern look with features suggesting this is a newer model targeting wealthy consumers. Targeting this same demographic, the solution that most adeptly simplifies the task for the end-user while also solving for the accessibility concerns presented is as follows: 
A sleek, microwave with a clear, usable handle to open and shut the door to the interior. The user uses the handle to open the door, places their object inside, shuts the door. A welcoming jingle will alert the customer, as well as a small, touchscreen display showing: "Cook Time?". A quiet AI voice, triggered upon the microwave door being opened from empty and contents placed inside, directs the consumer: "Say how long you'd like to cook for." The unit could be configured for any different type of lanugage, and the fingers-free design of the microwave ensures people can keep their hands sanitary as well as aid those with disabilities in using the unit. After the user replies with how long they'd like to run the unit for, the microwave's touchscreen display would give the user a 5 second grace period to cancel the identified time before automatically starting the cycle. This voice-activation approach ensures users can take minimal steps to accomplish their intended end goal, no matter if the cycle is for thirty seconds or an hour and a half at sixty percent power. We are able to communicate the most amount of information to the machine with the least load on the user. Additionally, due to the advanced nature of this machine and its AI voice assistant integration, users are able to configure the machine to behave more traditionally, yet still intuitively, if desired. A "simple" mode, would remove the AI voice assisting if users prefer a more traditional microwave experience. However, the touchscreen display is still simplified to ensure users of both modes have an equally seamless experience. Users can expect a small display showing the time, with digits 0-9 placed on the screen. Users are familiar with the 0-9 phone type number entry system and are likely to work well with this interface due to its universal nature. Aside from the time display and number buttons, a green start button clearly communicates how to begin the cooking process. This simplified, button approach provides an alternative for customization of the microwaving process, yet its dual capabilites give users an opportunity to adjust their machine's functionality in their intended way, providing consumers with optimal opportunity to achieve their preferred configuration and operation processes.
