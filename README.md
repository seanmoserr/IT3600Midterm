### Description of UX Problem:
A common problem identified in real-life examples is the user experience of working with microwaves and air fryers. These devices often have unnecessarily complicated user interfaces, leading to frustration of working with the various settings and buttons, only to receive limited feedback from the interface on the status of your task. As shown below, we see there is a pushable knob that retracts in and out to adjust the cook time of the process. After pushing the knob in, pressing start does not start the cycle. Buttons also exist with different, unlabeled values on the main interface. A clock button exists, as do two “P” and “M” buttons with an unclear purpose after interfacing with the display. The actual process of placing your object in the microwave, setting your desired cook time, and beginning the process is unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive. 


### Usability Critique: 

Although a usability critique of microwaves in general could be levied, the focus is on the specific interface pictured above. This interface does not feature an actual door to open and close the microwave door, instead opting for an unlabeled push button. This setup is generally unintuitive, but poses difficulty to people with disabilities who struggle with a pushing motion. Including a push button to open the door, in conjunction with an easy to use door, would make just this aspect of beginning the process painless for the user in the beginning. Additionally, a major issue lies in the dial / knob based configuration of cook times. Although it looks novel, that is likely for good reason. Directions for microwaving different items is often listed in explicit terms, meaning giving users a way to directly specify that time without needing to scroll by every time below their desired time requires additional effort from the user. Additionally, long cook times mean the user is forced to manually scroll the dial in an effort to reach their cook time, despite the fact there are also numbers of large, random quantities on the user interface, adding to the confusion of the setup. Allowing the dial to be pushed in and out also adds to the complexity of this simple task, as users now are left wondering if pushing the dial in or out is required to achieve some end goal (like starting the microwave, opening the door, etc).
